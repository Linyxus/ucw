# <s Cuisine Clock

A delightfully simple kitchen timer that lives in your terminal. Perfect for juggling multiple cooking tasks without leaving your command line workflow.

Create named timers with natural language (`a pasta 10m`, `a bread 1h30m`), pause and resume as needed, and get visual + audio alerts when time's up. Timer cards change color as deadlines approachgreen when relaxed, yellow when things heat up, and urgent red when your soufflé is seconds from disaster.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Then try: `a pasta 10m` to start a 10-minute pasta timer, or `p pasta` to pause it. Your terminal becomes a colorful kitchen command center.

Built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) for that crispy terminal UI experience.
